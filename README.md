# Unet-for-landcover-classification
This repository is used to record the codes that can be used for general land-cover classification in remote sensing applications. The whole processes will include: 1) data loading, splitting and merging, even for over-size data, such as bigger than 2G, 2) data augmentation and analyzation. 3) pipeline of training. 4) prediction augmentation.   

I will keep updating and giving more details about the code. 2019-10-09
